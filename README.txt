The main concept behind the EZ Grade application is to allow for streamlined application of both field data and blueprints 
to create easy to use reference data alongside on site grade checking equipment.

Core Functions:
    - Take starting and ending points (x,y,z) and give slope and interval points.
    - Give interval points as grade rod heights based on Hi (height of instrument).
    - Display data in an easily readable format that conveys x,y locations visually and z values numerically.
    - Apply cut/fill for area and estimate the cubic yardage of material to be removed or added.
        ~ Account for compaction of added material based on user given data:
            1. Condition of the material
            2. Material used to fill
            3. Condition/density of base fill is placed on
